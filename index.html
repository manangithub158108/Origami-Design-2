             while dove is a Germanic word that refers to the bird's diving flight.

            The giant panda also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south 
            central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, 
            and across its round body.

            Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their very extensive, not highly 
            modified, rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their 
            brow and snout.
